// FAQ data for structured data

  {
    question: "I've spent years trying to \"fix\" myself. Is this another form of self-improvement work?",
    answer: "No. This work is not about fixing you — it's about freeing you. You are not broken. What you're carrying may not even be yours — inherited beliefs, emotional imprints, survival patterns that once kept you safe. This work begins from that understanding."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes your approach different from traditional therapy or coaching?",
    answer: "I don't offer surface change. I guide identity-level transformation. I trained across trauma-informed modalities — NLP, hypnotherapy, EFT, timeline therapy, belief recoding, somatic integration — not to collect techniques, but to understand why insight alone doesn't create freedom. Real transformation happens when the body feels safe enough to release what the mind has been carrying for years."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to keep \"healing\" forever? I feel exhausted by it.",
    answer: "No. This is not about endless healing. It's about becoming who you were always meant to be. I support women who are capable and deeply self-aware — yet still feel held back by patterns they cannot think their way out of."
  },
  {
    question: "How will I know if this work is right for me?",
    answer: "Many approaches help you cope. This work helps you become. It is trauma-informed, culturally aware, and deeply integrative — designed for women who are ready for real change, not just understanding. If you're here, something in you already knows."
